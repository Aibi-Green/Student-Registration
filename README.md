# Student-Registration
A mini simple database project made in Eclipse.  
Implemented with Java, postgreSQL, and eclipse extension called windowbuilder.  

## Improvements in the future:  
How can I implement this using datasource import instead of drivermanager? (Connection Pooling)  
Improve to a better and adaptable GUI.
